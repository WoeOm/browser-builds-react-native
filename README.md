# ethereumjs browser builds

This repository contains browser builds of certain ethereumjs libraries.  They are built using browserify with a known set of working dependencies.

## Usage

In your web application, include only one of the builds form the `dist` directory. All exports will be available under the global `EthJS`.

**Note:** all packages expect ECMAScript 6 (ES6) as a minimum environment. From browsers lacking ES6 support, please use a shim (like [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim)) before including any of the builds from this repo.

## Build

Run `webpack` to generate a new set up builds. Change `package.json` to require different versions of the libraries.
